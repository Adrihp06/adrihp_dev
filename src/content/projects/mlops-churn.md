A production-ready MLOps pipeline orchestrated with Apache Airflow to automate the full lifecycle of a customer churn prediction model.

## Pipeline

The pipeline integrates data ingestion, validation, and model training steps, fully containerized using Docker to ensure environment reproducibility and scalability.

## Key Components

- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow DAGs for pipeline management
- **Containerization**: Docker for reproducible environments
- **Data Validation**: Automated quality checks before training
- **Model Training**: Automated retraining with versioning
- **Monitoring**: Model performance tracking and drift detection
