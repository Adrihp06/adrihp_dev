  "summary": "MLOps-driven Data Scientist & AI Engineer. I lead the development and deployment of AI solutions — designing end-to-end AI systems with a deep focus on scalable GenAI applications (LLMs, RAG, Agents) from concept to production. I turn models of all types — classical, deep learning, or generative — into robust, monitored production systems.",
